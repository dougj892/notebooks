This notebook esitmates the prevalence of Covid 19 in a population using fictional data from antibody tests from a sample of people.

I start with a very basic simple model and build up complexity from there.

## SRS and perfect test

With simple random sampling and perfect test accuracy, we just take the proportion of people who test positive in our sample as our estimate of prevalence. 

We usually calcualte confidence intervals in the usual way. 


## SRS with inaccurate (but validated )

Antibody tests are typically not 100% accurate. Things get a little trickier when this is the case.




## SRS with inaccurate test




## Convenience sampling and inaccurate test

This is the situation


## Same as above, with time trends
