    "First, we calculate the standard error for a given study design. For an RCT with no baseline and equal size treatment and control groups, the standard error of the difference between treatment and control is...\n",

    "## Step 2: Calculate rejection thresholds for each hypothesis test and overall\n",
    "We then calculate the \"rejection thresholds\" for each hypothesis test.  The rejection threshold is the smallest value for our estimate of the effect size, $\\hat{\\theta} $, above which we will reject the hypothesis test. \n",

Note that this means that rejthresh2 will be the binding threshold if $\\hat{\\sigma_{\\Delta}} < .25 $ and that rejthresh1 will be the binding threshold otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Calculate power for given effect size and overall rejection threshold\n",
    "Finally, we calculate the overall \"power\" for a given rejection threshold and true effect size $\\theta$. By \"power\" I mean the probability that we reject both hypotheses for a given study design, set of hypotheses, and effect size. Power is the probability that the estimated effect size is larger than the overall threshold which is...\n",
