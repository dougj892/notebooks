The purpose of this notebook is to figure out what data I already have and what data I need to import for the private schools paper.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
data_path <- "C:/Users/dougj/Documents/Data/Education"
states <- read_csv(file.path(data_path, "ASER trends over time", "aser_trends.csv"))
```
