title: "Prediction model for IHDS ASER"
output: html_notebook
---

## Summary
This notebook uses machine learning to assess whether household variables would be useful in imputing learning outcomes data.  In particular, I attempt to build a model to predict ASER scores and then test these predictions on a held out sample.

## Workflow
1. Split dataset into train and test (90/10 split since the dataset is large)
2. Run multinomial logit and linear regression with LASSO. (there is no obvious way to run ordered logit with LASSO)
2. Use cross validation to select best level of lambda for each
3. Run multi logit and linear regression on full training dataset for optimal level of lambda.
4. Get the list of variables selected from each model.
5. Run ordered logit with the two lists of variables.
6. Of the 3 models run on the full training dataset (multi logit, linear, and ordered logit), go with the one with the highest accuracy
7. Test 

## Remaining stuff to do
This notebook is not yet complete. Immediate next steps include:

1. Filter for instances where TA8B is not missing
2. Drop any variables which are all NA (or more than 10% NA)
2. Do a quick search and remove any other variables which don't make sense
3. Impute medians for all remaining variables
4. Figure out how to specify lm and mnl in glmnet (perhaps it just assumes mnl if y var is a factor)


### Install packages and load data

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(rsample)
library(Metrics)
library(sjmisc)
```

```{r}
ihds_ind_dir <- "C:/Users/dougj/Documents/Data/IHDS/IHDS 2012/DS0001"
ind_file <- file.path(ihds_ind_dir, "36151-0001-Data.dta")
# read in just those variables that i need
# this is much faster than reading in everything and then selecting
df <- read_dta(ind_file, col_select = c(STATEID, starts_with("RO"), starts_with("CS"), starts_with("TA"), starts_with("ED")))
df <- df %>% mutate(state = factor(STATEID)) %>% select(-STATEID)
# df <- read_dta(ind_file, col_select = c(STATEID, PSUID, URBAN2011, HHID, HHSPLITID, PERSONID, IDPSU, WT, RO3, RO7, RO5, starts_with("CS"), starts_with("TA"), starts_with("ED")) )
```

### Process dataset and split

```{r}

data_split <- initial_split(df, prop = .9)
training_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)
```

### Run multi logit and linear, both with LASSO
```{r}
model <- train(
  TA8B ~.,
  training_data,
  method = "glmnet",
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    alpha = 1,
    lambda = seq(0.0001,1, length = 20)
  ),
  trControl = trainControl(
    method = "cv",
    number = 10
  )
)
```
