title: "Explore ASER state and district data"
output: html_notebook
---

The purpose of this notebook is mainly to put graphs and other analyes from the other notebooks that are useful but which I don't want to include in them so that they don't get too cluttered.

```{r setup, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
path <- "C:/Users/dougj/Documents/Data/Education/ASER District Data/Clean"
figures <- "C:/Users/dougj/Documents/Education in India/Original research/Learning outcomes data/figures"
dists <- read_csv(file.path(path, "aser_district_partial.csv"))
path <- "C:/Users/dougj/Documents/Data/Education/ASER trends over time"
states <- read_csv(file.path(path, "aser_trends.csv")) %>% select(year, State, std3_reading, std3_math)
```

Graph ASER reading scores over time for the 5 largest states. 

```{r}
# selected_states <- sample(unique(states$state),5)
# random_5 <- states %>% filter(State %in% selected_states)

top_5 <- c("uttarpradesh", "maharashtra", "bihar", "westbengal", "madhyapradesh", "andhrapradesh")
top_5_df <- states %>% filter(State %in% top_5)
ggplot(top_5_df, aes(x = year, y = std3_reading, color = State)) +
  geom_line()
```
Plot line graphs for districts std35_std1 for districts in a randomly selected state to get a feel for the data.

```{r}
state <- sample(unique(dists$State),1)
one_state <- dists %>% filter(State == state)
ggplot(one_state, aes(x = year, y = std12_letters_and_up, color = District)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + ylim(c(50,100)) 
```



Histogram of deltas with normal curve with standard distribution of .05 overlaid on top. 

```{r}

# Create variable for deltas and first and second lag of the delta
dist_deltas <- dists %>% 
  group_by(State, District) %>% 
  mutate(delta_letters = std12_letters_and_up - lag(std12_letters_and_up, order_by = year), delta_nums = std12_numbers_and_up - lag(std12_numbers_and_up)) %>%
  mutate(delta_letters_lagged = lag(delta_letters, order_by = year), delta_letters_dbl_lag = lag(delta_letters, n= 2, order_by = year)) %>%
  arrange(State, District, year)

ggplot(dist_deltas, aes(x=delta_letters))+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean=0, sd = 5), col = "red")+
  geom_density()
```
